# Title

This project will investigate the Wisconsin Breast Cancer diagnostics dataset and apply classifiers to the dataset. I will complete a statistical analysis and also take a review of some of the literature. I will finally then review how we can extend the dataset. 

## About Me

I am a student in Atlantic Technological University who is studying Programming for Data Analysis during Winter 22/23.

## Setup

I have used a Jupyter Notebook to document by research and using Python. The main.ipynb file contains the analysis. I would suggest running the first part with the imports and then running each cell separately, I used Anaconda Prompt to run the Jupyter notebook and developed the code this way. In some parts I read in an excel file, I would suggest downloading these from the data folder.


## What is Breast Cancer and how has deep learning and machine learning helped with the detection?

Breast cancer is cancer that starts in the breast tissue. Breast cancer can cause symptoms such as a lump, but a lump is not the only symptom of breast cancer. Breast cancer mainly affects older women. Most breast cancers (80%) occur in women over the age of 50. And the older you are, the higher your risk. Men can also get breast cancer, but this is rare. Most men who get breast cancer are over 60. Breast cancer is caused by a combination of our genes, environment and lifestyles.
 
Breast cancer can be detected early, allowing patients to obtain proper therapy and so increase their chances of survival. Arooj et al have documented some of the ways that help early detection.[2] Imaging technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diagnostic mammography  (X-rays), thermography, and ultrasound (sonography) can help analyze and identify breast cancer. The use of classification, by identifying nucleus traits, cancerous cells of breast cancer can be classified as benign and malignant has seen much improvement over the years. These classification methods such as KNN, SVM, and decision tree have been pivotel. These classifiers can test the data to give statistical figures of the accuracy of the data, and then normalisation can be used to improve these tests. I will be looking at some of the literature and how these classifiers were used on the Wisconsin data set.

## What is the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic Data Set?

Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset obtained by the university of Wisconsin Hospital is used to classify tumors as benign or malignant.

## Project Description

The Projects Features Detection of Breast Cancer Using Machine Learning.

It has been tested that while there exists several machine learning models,Support Vector Machine or SVM in short is reported to have highest accuracy of (approximately 96%/97%) in detecting breast cancer and I will show how to use SVM and then to apply gamma parameters to normalise the data even further. 

There has been a lot of literature on this topic, but I tried to do a fairly thorough investigation of two of the literature around this and then I looked at some of the other data that has been.
